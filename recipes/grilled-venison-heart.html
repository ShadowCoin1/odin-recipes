    <h1>Grilled Venison Hearts</h1>
    <img src="../images_recipes/deerhearts.jpeg">
    <p>The heart of venison is one of the best cuts on the animal. It takes to the open flame of the grill nicely, bringing out the earthy sweetness</p>
    <p>The preparation is simple and quick, like most good cuts of meat it really only needs salt, pepper and heat.</p>
    <p>The heart of the whitetail is not huge so saving up several makes for a soild meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-4 venison hearts cleaned and split open</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>High quality olive oil</li>
        
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare hearts by removing any excess fat and then split them open, trim out the valves and connective tissue and cut into strips or pieces as you deem fit.</li>
        <li>Apply olive oil and salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Light grill preferable using hardwood as fuel or hardwood lump charcoal.</li>
        <li>Grill until warm 5-7 minutes. Again you are looking for rare to medium rare. </li>
    </ol>
