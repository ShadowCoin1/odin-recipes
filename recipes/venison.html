    <h1>Roasted Venison</h1>

    <img src="../images_recipes/roasted-venison.jpg">
  <p>This is an easy and eye catching preparation on par with any fine cut of beef.  Be sure to leave this roast rare to medium rare. Cooked any more and the cut becomes tough and much less delicious.</p>
<p>The cut can be anything from the hind quarter or the backstrap or even a section of the front should with bone in. Be sure to have a quality meat thermoter on hand. You are shooting for 125 degrees for rare.</p>
